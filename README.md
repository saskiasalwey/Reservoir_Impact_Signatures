This repository contains the scripts and data needed to calculate the signatures introduced in Salwey et al. (2022) and to produce plots alligned with those presented in the paper. 

Signature functions are presented in signature_functions.py and this script is called upon in the assosiated jupyter notebook to produce plots and demonstrate how to collate data.The workflow in the Paper_Code notebook requires the user to download the CAMELS-GB dataset and Data Set S1 from Salwey et al. (2022).
